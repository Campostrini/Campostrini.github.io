Hi there, I'm Stefano. I studied Physics and Meteorology in [Heidelberg](https://goo.gl/maps/DSahwZhXrt2cuiW17), [Padua](https://goo.gl/maps/VV1oiETwKJPTrdjS6), [Trento](https://goo.gl/maps/N367xhRArai7VNAa9) and [Innsbruck](https://goo.gl/maps/ajT8SEwosVppEMYD8). 

You can read my MSc Thesis "Precipitation Nowcasting\: A Deep Learning Approach" [here](https://diglib.uibk.ac.at/ulbtirolhs/content/titleinfo/7782855). I wrote it during the ups and downs of the pandemic under the supervision of [Prof. Mayr](https://www.uibk.ac.at/acinn/people/georg-mayr.html.en). You can find the LaTeX source of the Thesis and the Python source of the Deep Learning model on my [github]({{ site.author.links[1].url }}).
